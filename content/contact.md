## Instructor: Melissa Dix

![Melissa Dix](/images/MelissaDix.jpg "Melissa Dix")  
My name is Melissa Dix and I'll be one of the instructors for your courses.
I've been at Blackhawk Technical College for 3 years. Prior to BTC, I worked for 15 years at Beloit College. I enjoy teaching and love being part of higher education. I live in Beloit with my husband and two children at home. We have two dogs and in my free time during the warm months, I love to kayak! During the winter I tend to stay home and read books. I am a huge Stephen King fan!<br>
I am very passionate about technology and love sharing my passion for it with others. I geek out over the Internet of Things and am comitted to making my home a fully functional Smart Home using Amazon devices. Programming suits me well because I love figuring out puzzles and I am very creative and analytical. I believe that persistence is the most important tool in my arsenal.<br>
I look forward to getting to know you as you move through the program. I am always here to help if you have questions or need assistance, and am just a phone call or email away!<br>
