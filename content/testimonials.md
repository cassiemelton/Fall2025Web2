The Web Development Program at BTC really helped me get the knowledge I needed in order to be able to step into the tech field. I started as a complete beginner and received all the support I needed in order to successfully complete this program.

I wanted to change careers so I turned to Blackhawk Tech because it was my community college. BTC had all the resources I needed to succeed with the Web Development Program. Their Student Services Center helped me with tutoring and equipment rental.

The program's class flexibility is really what made graduation possible for me. I was able to work and go to school at the same time.
